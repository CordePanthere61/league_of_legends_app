## C# & Postgresql School Project from my third year at CÃ©gep de Sorel-Tracy
#### WPF C# Desktop application with a Postrgresql database

I built a postgresql database about a game called League of Legends. The schema was containing 14 tables.

Then I built a WPF C# desktop application to interact with those entities.
